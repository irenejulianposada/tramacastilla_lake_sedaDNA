This code and dataset belong with the *in prep* paper: **Neolithic pastoralism and plant community interactions at high altitudes of the Pyrenees, Southern Europe** (Juli√°n-Posada *et al*., 2024)

We performed sedimentary ancient DNA (*sed*aDNA) analysis in a Pyrenean lacustrine sequence (Tramacastilla Lake, 1682 m a.s.l.).

File *Tramacastilla_shortcomm.Rmd* includes all the code needed to obtain the results of the paper.\
File *TRAM.RData* includes all data needed to run the code provided.
